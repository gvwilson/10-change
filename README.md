# Ten Simple Rules for Changing Organizations

-   [Greg Wilson](http://third-bit.com)

## Rule 1: Be sure this is where you want to focus your efforts.

-   It's going to take years,
    it could well fail,
    and there are many other things you could do,
    so be sure this particular change is the one you want to fight for.

## Rule 2: Ask those who will be affected.

-   "Nothing for us without us" (nihil pro nobis sine nobis).
-   Asking for opinions often reveals potential allies.

## Rule 3: Be specific.

-   Nobody would argue (in public) against fair hiring practices, but:
    -   the organization has to implement something specific in order for that to mean anything, and
    -   people very well might argue against those specifics.
-   So pick something specific and achievable.
    -   And make a concrete plan for achieving it.
-   Start with whatever is likely to have broadest support,
    because success breeds success.

## Rule 4: Figure out who actually has the power to make that change and what they actually care about.

-   Your neighbors don't make policy for your local public school: school board trustees do.
-   How can you influence them?
    -   Help someone who wants the same change as you get elected (or run for office yourself).
    -   Help someone who doesn't oppose your change with something they care about in exchange for support for your cause.
-   Conversely, figure out who is going to be negatively impacted by this change.
    -   If it's going to eliminate jobs, what else can those people usefully do?

## Rule 5: Build alliances.

-   "I'll help you if you'll help me" makes the world go around.
    -   This is *not* cynical: people whose beliefs are aligned may still have different priorities.
    -   Hard part is when you want the same thing for very different reasons.
-   Good allies are:
    -   People who want the same thing you do.
    -   People who have a high profile (either inside your group or externally).
    -   People who have a wide range of connections within the group.
-   The flip side of this is to accept that some people will never be your allies.
    -   If everyone wanted it, you wouldn't have to push for the change.

## Rule 6: Test the waters.

-   At every stage, refine your idea and presentation in front of a small group first.
-   When done honestly,
    "refining your idea" occasionally means acknowledging that you wanted the wrong thing.
-   Can be useful to ask someone to be the official skeptic.
    -   Giving someone a way to critique in private may temper their public criticism,
        and you just might convert them.

## Rule 7: Keep it visible.

-   It's easy to start a blog and create a Twitter account,
    but that very ease has reduced these channels' impact.
-   Is there a newsletter you can be included in (which makes you look more official)?
-   Can you make a presentation as part of some other event (rather than organizing a gathering of your own)?
-   Can you get someone with a higher profile to mention what you're doing and point people your way?
-   Can you post notices in the lunchroom? The elevator? The washrooms? Local restaurants?
-   People will do things for t-shirts and stickers that they won't do for money.
-   And always share a single point of contact.
    -   That someone checks frequently.

## Rule 8: Collect data but tell stories.

-   Sooner or later someone is going to ask what financial impact this change is going to have,
    so be ready for that.
    -   Data about other changes or from other organizations helps a lot.
-   But data doesn't have nearly as powerful an impact as stories.
    -   Don't explain what *kind* of people this will help:
        explain how it helped a specific person,
        or how it would make a specific person's life better.
    -   If you've never cried when telling that story,
        tell a better story.

## Rule 9: Learn how to run meetings and make decisions.

-   You can get the change you want without being a great public speaker,
    but you *must* know how to run a meeting and make decisions.
-   For meetings:
    1.  Start with an agenda.
    2.  Take minutes.
    3.  Have a moderator to keep things on track.
    4.  Require politeness.
-   For decisions, use Martha's Rules:
    1.  Anyone can sponsor a proposal by sharing it with the group.
    2.  A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are present.
    3.  After the sponsor presents the proposal,
        a preliminary +1/0/-1 vote is cast prior to any discussion.
    4.  If all or most of the group likes or can live with the proposal,
        it is immediately moved to a final vote.
    5.  If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal,
        it is postponed for further rework by the sponsor.
    6.  Otherwise,
        members who are uncomfortable briefly state their objections.
        After a short moderated discussion,
        the facilitator calls a final vote.
    7.  The final vote is straight yes-or-no.
        If a majority votes "yes" the proposal is adopted.
        Otherwise,
        it is returned to its sponsor for more work.

## Rule 10: Celebrate when you can, grieve when you need to.

-   Burnout is an occupational hazard for everyone trying to make meaningful change.
    -   We get so used to doing things on our own at the start
        that we don't share the load even when there are people to share it with.
-   Not all of your allies will become your friends,
    but those who do will be able to share your victories
    and commiserate with your defeats like no one else.
